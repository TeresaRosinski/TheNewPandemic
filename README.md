## Description

_This is a 2 day project at Epicodus to build a Pandemic style board game.  A game where 2 players collaborate to defeat the infection rate.  Players roll dice to reduce, or increase(!) the infection rate and every 60 seconds the value of the roll is changed.  The goal is to reduce the infection rate to 0._
